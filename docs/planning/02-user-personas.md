# 02 - User Personas

## Primary User

### Profile
- **Name**: The AI-First Solopreneur
- **Role**: Solo developer / Solopreneur building products independently
- **Technical Level**: Semi-technical — can read and understand code, guides AI to write it
- **Primary Goal**: Build and launch products using AI as the primary coding engine

### Goals (in priority order)
1. Build products/apps to launch and sell
2. Automate tasks for existing business operations
3. Learn and experiment with new technologies

### Pain Points (Current State)
What frustrations does this user have today?

- **Workflow disconnect** — Constantly switching between Claude terminal and browser to see app changes
- **Blind to progress** — No visibility into what files Claude is modifying without manual checking
- **Context loss** — New terminal sessions lose all previous conversation history and context
- **Cost pressure** — Heavy AI usage burns through subscription limits; no way to optimize which AI handles which task
- **No project visibility** — Hard to track overall progress on roadmaps, sprints, and milestones while working

### Use Cases
What specific tasks will they accomplish with Wingman?

| Use Case | Description | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| AI-powered development | Chat with Claude to build features, fix bugs, implement ideas | Daily |
| Live preview monitoring | Watch app preview update in real-time while AI codes | Daily |
| AI cost optimization | Switch to cheaper/local AI for simple tasks, save Claude for complex work | Daily |
| Project management | Review and manage roadmap, sprints, milestones, task progress | Daily |
| Session resumption | Pick up previous conversations with full context | Daily |
| New project kickoff | Start brand new projects from scratch | Daily/Weekly |

### Workflow Expectations
How does this user expect to interact with the app?

1. **Launch** → See projects/sessions dashboard
2. **Select** → Pick existing project or start new one
3. **Work** → Chat panel on left, preview/activity panel on right
4. **Observe** → Watch results appear in real-time as AI works

## Secondary Users (If Any)

### Other Solopreneurs / Indie Developers
- **Profile**: Similar to primary user — semi-technical builders using AI to ship products
- **Needs**: Same core needs; may have different AI provider preferences
- **Priority**: Low (for now) — build for yourself first, share later
- **Note**: Potential to productize if demand emerges; keep architecture extensible

## Anti-Personas
Who is this NOT for?

- **Enterprise teams** — Need collaboration features, permissions, audit trails (not in scope)
- **Pure non-technical users** — Can't read or understand code at all; need more hand-holding
- **Manual code writers** — Prefer typing code themselves; better served by VS Code/Cursor
- **Casual AI chatters** — Just want to talk to AI, not building products
